#### Report
This report includes the following:
- Fundamental Concepts: Definitions of Processor, ISA(Instruction Set Architecture), and Pipelining.
- Comparative Analysis: A detailed comparison of three modern processors, each from a different system scale, against the MIPS architecture.
- Processors Profiled:
  - ARM Cortex-M4: Representing small-scale embedded systems.
  - Intel Core i-series: Representing personal computer systems. 
  - NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU: Representing large-scale supercomputer systems.
- Key Comparison Criteria: In-depth analysis of their respective ISA and pipeline structures in contrast to MIPS.
- Summary and Conclusion: A final summary of findings and concluding remarks on the processor comparison.
